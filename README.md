# Data Analyst Portfolio.

### About me 
I’m a data analyst with a strong focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that drive business value. With hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I’ve worked on real-world projects ranging from insurance claims analysis to marketing performance and customer behaviour. My approach blends analytical thinking with practical problem-solving, helping teams make informed decisions backed by data.

I’m passionate about continuous learning and using data to tell meaningful stories. Whether it’s exploring customer behavior, optimizing operations, or visualizing performance, I'm always having fun with data, I aim to create solutions that are insightful, impactful, and easy to understand.

### Skills
Data Analytics - (Tools: Python, SQL, Excel, Rapid Miner)
Data Visualisation - (Tools: Tableau, PowerBI, Looker studio)

###  Projects
### 1. Core 29: Business Intelligence Dashboard: Work utilization, Project Status. 
Tool: Tableau

The project focused on building insightful dashboards for Core29, a tech-driven project management company, to visualize team performance and project progress. I analyzed data on billable hours, workloads, project durations, and issue tracking to uncover imbalances in employee utilization and highlight key performance indicators. By utilizing Tableau, I revealed that some team members were overworked while others were underutilized. The dashboards also provided clarity on project statuses and other KPIs. These insights helped the client identify bottlenecks, improve team efficiency, and align project management strategies with business goals.

### 2. Optimising Insurance Claim in Autoinsurance. 
Tool: Python via google colab.

The project focused on analyzing four years of insurance data (2015–2018) to identify trends in policyholder behavior, claim frequency, and overall policy performance. With a 13% rise in auto insurance claims reported in late 2024, insurers face growing financial pressure. I explored relationships between premiums, vehicle type, location, and claims using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly). A secondary dataset added insight into specific claim types like theft or accidents. The analysis revealed patterns that support better pricing, fraud detection, and customer segmentation. This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into practical strategies that improve financial stability in insurance.

### 3. Database Management System. 
Tool: SQL via MySQL

This project is a relational database management system for Inchgarth Community Centre to manage room bookings and activity attendance. I designed key tables such as Activity, Attendance, Bookings, Members, Membership, Payment, Rooms, and Staff, establishing relationships through foreign keys and primary keys. For example, the Activity table was linked to Attendance via a foreign key, and Members were connected to Membership. I implemented constraints on different columns like membership status and date/time to ensure data integrity. Additionally, we performed pilot testing using complex SQL queries and joining tables to ensure the system was running smoothly.

### 4. Customer Discount Campaign for Altrix Superstore
Tools Used: RapidMiner, Logistic Regression, Data Cleaning, Classification Models

Focus: Predictive Modeling, Data Storytelling, Customer Segmentation

This project tackled a real-world business challenge for Altrix Superstore, which aimed to identify which customers were most likely to accept a discounted gold membership offer. I began with deep data exploration on a customer dataset containing 2,240 records and 22 variables, covering demographics, spending behavior, and past complaints.

After resolving missing values and transforming variables for analysis, I tested three classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Logistic Regression performed best, with 84.3% accuracy, 72% recall, 48% precision, and an AUC score of 0.878.

The model revealed key predictors such as education level (PhD, Masters), presence of children at home, marital status (Widow), complaint history, and web visit frequency. Interestingly, income was not a significant factor in the prediction.

Throughout the project, I recorded a video walkthrough for stakeholders, guiding them through my thought process, modeling decisions, and business implications in a clear, accessible way. The final deliverable included actionable recommendations, model deployment strategies, and communication materials to support the campaign launch.
