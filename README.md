###  Projects
### 1. Core 29: Business Intelligence Dashboard: Work utilization, Project Status. 
Tool: Tableau
The project focused on building insightful dashboards for Core29, a tech-driven project management company, to visualize team performance and project progress. I analyzed data on billable hours, workloads, project durations, and issue tracking to uncover imbalances in employee utilization and highlight key performance indicators. By utilizing Tableau, I revealed that some team members were overworked while others were underutilized. The dashboards also provided clarity on project statuses and other KPIs. These insights helped the client identify bottlenecks, improve team efficiency, and align project management strategies with business goals.

### 2. Optimising Insurance Claim in Autoinsurance. 
Tool: Python via google colab.
The project focused on analyzing four years of insurance data (2015â€“2018) to identify trends in policyholder behavior, claim frequency, and overall policy performance. With a 13% rise in auto insurance claims reported in late 2024, insurers face growing financial pressure. I explored relationships between premiums, vehicle type, location, and claims using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly). A secondary dataset added insight into specific claim types like theft or accidents. The analysis revealed patterns that support better pricing, fraud detection, and customer segmentation. This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into practical strategies that improve financial stability in insurance.

### 3. Database Management System. 
Tool: SQL via MySQL
This project is a relational database management system for Inchgarth Community Centre to manage room bookings and activity attendance. I designed key tables such as Activity, Attendance, Bookings, Members, Membership, Payment, Rooms, and Staff, establishing relationships through foreign keys and primary keys. For example, the Activity table was linked to Attendance via a foreign key, and Members were connected to Membership. I implemented constraints on different columns like membership status and date/time to ensure data integrity. Additionally, we performed pilot testing using complex SQL queries and joining tables to ensure the system was running smoothly.
